# TicketingSystem
 Chapter 10 Adv. C# Assignment

The program functions as intended. There are minor presentation/visual issues that could be debugged in the future but the application meets all of the assignment's requirements.

Program Description:
This program is a rudimentary ticketing system utilizing Agile methodology. Primarily follows the ToDo List example from Murach's ASP.NET Core Chapter 10. Allows for creating and filtering of tickets by Name, Sprint Number, Point Value, and Status. 

Name - name of the ticket being created
Sprint Number - (1-10 to sort by priority)
Point Value - (Fibonacci Sequence for Point Values Spread) How much work needs to be put into this ticket.
Status - Either ToDo (td), InProgress (ip), QualityAssurance (qa), or Done (d)
